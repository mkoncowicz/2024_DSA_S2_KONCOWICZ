# Database Configuration
# To connect your own database, create a file named application-local.yaml,
# provide your database details there. In ProjectflowApplication, you can change the profile to "local"
# to use the configurations from application-local.yaml. Be cautious not to commit sensitive data to GitHub.
# It is recommended to use separate files like application-[profile].properties and the "local" profile for enhanced security.
# You can also change profiles through the "Run/Debug Configuration" in your IDE.
# By default, username for Postgres is postgres

# To run database locally:
# use command: docker run --name some-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD={{password}} -e POSTGRES_DB={{database}} -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
# create file: application-local.yaml and configure all properties which are shown in application.properties
# application will create table with sample data at each start of the software
